### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project : Weakly supervised learning-- label noise and correction

Team members: Cao Shengqi, Dingore Saloni, He Haoyu, Xue Fei, Zhang Renqi


Summary: In this project, we created a predictive model to conduct image classification. We input the images and the labels to find the pattern behind the noisy labels and correct all the noise. Then we return on model 1 to predict.

[Contribution Statement] 
Cao, Shengqi worked on model 2, correct labels.
Xue, Fei also worked on model 2, correct labels.
Dingore, Saloni worked on intial data preprocessing and model 1 development.
Zhang, Renqi worked on model 1 development and helped building model 2.
He, Haoyu helped building model 2 and organize models.
